      <p>
        Medicinal marijuana uses the marijuana plant or chemicals in it to treat
        diseases or conditions. It's basically the same product as recreational
        marijuana, but it's taken for medical purposes. The cannabis plant
        contains more than 100 different chemicals called cannabinoids. Each one
        has a different effect on the body. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
        and cannabidiol (CBD) are the main chemicals used in medicine. THC also
        produces the “high” people feel when they smoke marijuana or eat foods
        containing it.

      <h2>Where is Marijuana Illegal?</h2>
      <p>
        In Nebraska and North Carolina, while marijuana remains illegal, certain
        small amounts have been decriminalized, resulting in penalties but
        typically not criminal prosecution. In the states of Georgia, Indiana,
        Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin, marijuana is both
        illegal and not decriminalized. However, the use of CBD products is
        permitted. In Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina, and Wyoming, all forms of
        cannabis, including marijuana and CBD products, are completely illegal
        with no decriminalization measures in place.

        The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a San
        Jose, Calif.-based, nonprofit founded in 1986 to raise awareness and
        understanding of psychedelic substances, conducted the study. In it, the
        research showed improvements in samples containing 11 percent CBD, as
        well as mixed samples containing 8 percent of both THC and CBD. “This
        study served as the first randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing
        the therapeutic potential of varying ratios of THC and CBD for treating
        symptoms of PTS,” said Dr. Marcel O. Bonn-Miller, lead author of the
        study. Bonn-Miller added that the next step of the study involves
        conducting larger, randomized placebo-controlled trials. “It would help
        determine the minimally-effective doses of THC needed to safely treat
        individuals suffering from PTSD,” Bonn-Miller said. “It will also
        mitigate risks of cannabis dependence in this vulnerable population.”
        The results published on March 17 extend from a separate, 150-person
        study conducted in December 2020. In that study, MAPS compared
        participants diagnosed with PTSD who used prescribed cannabis with other
        PTSD sufferers who do not use cannabis to treat symptoms. Over the
        course of a year, the study found that cannabis users reported a greater
        decrease in the severity of their PTSD symptoms. They also were more
        than 2.5 times as likely to no longer meet the diagnostic criteria for
        PTSD as those who did not use cannabis. The 2020 study, unlike its most
        recent version published on March 17, had not implemented the added use
        of placebo control. “One of the biggest takeaways from this study is
        that veterans with PTSD can use cannabis at self-managed doses, at least
        in the short term, and not experience a plethora of side effects or a
        worsening of symptoms,” said Mallory Lofl in, a co-author of the paper
        and volunteer assistant professor of psychiatry at the UC San Diego
        School of Medicine. The main component of cannabis is THC
        (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), an intoxicating and psychoactive
        ingredient that produces the euphoric “high” effect. Unlike CBD, one of
        the non-intoxicating cannabinoids in the cannabis plant, the use of THC
        has not been as widely adopted in the U.S. for medical, therapeutic and
        recreational uses. As of May 18, cannabis has been legalized for
        widespread medical use in 36 states and four U.S. territories, according
        to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Cannabis also has been
        legalized for both medical and recreational use in 16 states, Washington
        D.C., and two U.S. territories. Cannabis is still prohibited for
        prescription use by the Department of Defense and VA. Meanwhile, the VA
        estimates that 11 to 20 percent of recent veterans of the wars in Iraq
        and Afghanistan, and as many as one-third of all veterans, suffer from
        PTSD. As approved and amended at its 118th National Convention in 2017,
        the VFW continues to stand and support federally funded research of
        medicinal cannabis for veterans being treated by the VA for
        service-related chronic pain.
